                description: 'Since tables represent data in a tabular fashion, they have columns and rows. But that\'s too easy, so we will call them fields and records sometimes. Anyways, this exact SELECT statement selects each and every field (column) and record (row) from our table. You might be thinking: Oh, that is what the star is for? Well, yes and no. After the keyword SELECT we put the star to indicate that we want all the columns. Then where do we specify, which rows we want? Excellent question, my padawan. It is by default that we select all records. We will eventually filter the rows, but that is a different story. Run the query again, and step, you know, to the next step.',
